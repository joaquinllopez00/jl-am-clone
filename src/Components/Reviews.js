      "Having just gone through the new mortgage process, we could not have had a better experience than we had with Carrie Johnston! Carrie welcomed us into her office, used our time efficiently and was able to make this a smooth process. Carrie went one step further and attended our closing to ensure all went well. Not meany can say the person who arranged their mortgage would go to this effort!, Thank you, Carrie Johnston! We will recommend you to anyone looking for superior service!",
